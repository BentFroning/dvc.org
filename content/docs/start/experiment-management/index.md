# Get Started: Experiment Management

Let's look at DVC's features from the perspective of machine learning experiment
management. This includes bootstrapping, running and queueing experiments
(possibly in parallel), as well as visually comparing the results to commit the
best ones to Git.

## Following the Get Started

Each page in this trail is an independent chapter you can go to directly,
although they are presented in a good order if you plan to cover them all. There
may be linked notes and references about other chapters or docs, but you can
skip them and still get a good idea of the features in question, even by only
reading page sections.

For better learning, you can also try each step yourself and get to similar
results. Some of the required steps for this may be inside collapsed sections
you can click on to expand:
