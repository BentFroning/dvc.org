# Get Started: Experiment Management

Let's look at DVC's features from the perspective of machine learning experiment
management. This includes bootstrapping, running and queueing experiments
(possibly in parallel), as well as visually comparing the results to commit the
best ones to Git.

## Following the Get Started

Although presented in a logical order, each page in this trail is an independent
chapter you can go to directly. There may be references to other chapters or
docs, but you can skip them and still get a good idea of the features in
question, even by only reading page sections.

For better learning, you can also try each step yourself and get to similar
results. Some of the required steps for this may be inside collapsed sections
you can click on to expand:
