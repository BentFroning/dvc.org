# Get Started: Data Management

Let's look at DVC's features from the perspective of data and machine learning
model management. This includes automatic caching; versioning on top of Git
(without storing in the Git repo); sharing, exploring, and accessing remotely,
among other tasks.

We can also build and version pipelines to capture our data workflows stage by
stage, from raw data and its pre-processing, through feature engineering and ML
model training, and up to evaluation (performance metrics), visualization, or
other post-processing.

## Following the Get Started

Each page in this trail is an independent chapter you can go to directly,
although they are presented in a good order if you plan to cover them all. There
may be linked notes and references about other chapters or docs, but you can
skip them and still get a good idea of the features in question, even by only
reading page sections.

For better learning, you can also try each step yourself and get to similar
results. Some of the required steps for this may be inside collapsed sections
you can click on to expand:
